Use the Web API that was given to you in class on Wednesday and create a small web application in Visual Studio that consumes the Web API. Use Chapter 16 starting on page 702 in your Price Text Book.




I'm not 100% on what i'm doing. I think what is going on here is the MVC or whatever the book spoke about is running something that handles the actual data.
Then this "API" acts as a go between, running between the user and that MVC thing, keeping the source data a step removed from the end user.
I'm still not sure i configured it correctly, but it only worked when i ran a second copy i have of the original StudentWebAPI.
after the flu i seem to have caught a bad case of bronchitis and the doc is worried it will become pneumonia.
Between the bronchitis since sat (4/6) and the drugs they put me on friday (4/12) its been very difficult to sit in front of the comp and get any work done.
I really wanted spring break to do research and get ahead and such but its been rough. I will continue to move forward as best i can.
